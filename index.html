        <h2>How to prepare White Sauce Pasta</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Boil raw pasta according to the instructions given on the package or follow following instructions; Take 4-5
                cups water in deep sauce pan, bring it to boil over medium flame. When it start boiling, add 3/4 cup Penne
                pasta and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Boil them until al-dente (cooked but not very soft). It will take around 10-12
                minutes. To check whether pasta is cooked or not, take one pasta in a fork and bite it. If it is little firm
                to bite, it is cooked. If it is too hard to bite, it requires more cooking. Transfer cooked pasta to a large
                colander and drain excess water.</li>
            <br>
            <li>While pasta is cooking, heat 1/2 teaspoon oil in a pan or kadai over high flame. Add 1/4 cup chopped carrot,
                1/4 cup chopped green capsicum, 1/4 cup chopped red capsicum, 1/4 cup chopped broccoli and salt. Stir and
                cook until veggies are little cooked but still crunchy, for around 2-3 minutes. Turn off the flame and transfer
                them to a plate.</li>
            </br>
            <li>Heat 1½ tablespoons butter in the same pan or kadai over medium flame. Add 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
                and sauté for 30 seconds. Add 1 tablespoon maida (all purpose flour). Stir continuously and cook for a minute.Pour
                1 cup milk little by little while stirring continuously with a whisk. Stir and mix for 1-2 minutes.Reduce
                flame to low. Continue stirring and cooking until mixture starts to thicken. It will take around 3-4 minutes
                depending on the size and thickness of the pan. When mixture starts to coat the back of a spoon as shown
                in the picture here, it means that it has started to thicken. Add 1/4 teaspoon oregano, 1/4 teaspoon red
                chilli flakes, a pinch of black pepper powder and salt. Mix well.
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>Add sautéed vegetables and pasta. Turn off the flame. Mix well. Transfer it to a serving plate. White sauce pasta
                is now ready. Garnish it with grated cheese and serve while they are still hot.</li>
